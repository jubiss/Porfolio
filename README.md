Hello! My name is José, but you can also call me Zé or Jubi. Welcome to Portfolio.

Here you will find the links to my project repositories, along with brief descriptions of each project and the key findings or results. If you want more detailed information, you can find it in the repositories or you can send me a message.

Please note that I am still updating my old projects, so you may come across changes from time to time.

You can download my curriculum here: [insert link to curriculum]
