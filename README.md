Hello! My name is José, but you can also call me Zé or Jubi. Welcome to Portfolio.

Here you will find the link to my project repositories, along with brief descriptions of each project and key findings or results. If you want more detailed information, I have provided additional details within the repositories.

Please note that I am continuously updating my repositories and portfolio, so you may come across changes from time to time.
